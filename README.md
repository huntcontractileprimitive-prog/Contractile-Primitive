# Contractile-Primitive
Exploratory work on contractile primitives, actuation, and emergent behavior.

# Contractile Primitive

This repository documents exploratory work on contractile primitives — physical actuation elements and feedback loops used to study how behavior and coordination can emerge from simple constraints.

The focus here is not on finished products or optimization, but on understanding primitives: force, timing, bias, feedback, and structure. Experiments are treated as probes rather than proofs.

## What this project is
- A public lab notebook
- A place to record experiments, failures, and working hypotheses
- An exploration of actuation and behavior from the bottom up

## What this project is not
- A product
- A startup
- A complete theory of intelligence
- A polished or finalized system

## What you'll find here
- Experiment logs and design notes
- Photos, sketches, and videos of prototypes
- Simple code or control logic when relevant
- Open questions and dead ends

## Current direction
Right now, the work is focused on:
- Contractile elements and simple actuation mechanisms
- Feedback and bias introduced at the physical or control level
- Observing how behavior changes before higher-level planning is introduced

This repository will evolve as experiments progress.
