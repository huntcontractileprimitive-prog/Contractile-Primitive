# Experiment 001 — Baseline Contractile Behavior

## Purpose
To observe and document the basic behavior of a contractile element without added feedback, optimization, or adaptive control.

This experiment serves as a baseline reference for later variations.

## Setup
- Description of the contractile element used
- Materials involved
- Power source or actuation method
- Any constraints intentionally applied

## Expectation
What I expected to happen before testing.

## Observation
What actually happened.
Include anything unexpected, unstable, or unclear.

## Notes
- Initial impressions
- Questions raised by the behavior
- Ideas for follow-up experiments
