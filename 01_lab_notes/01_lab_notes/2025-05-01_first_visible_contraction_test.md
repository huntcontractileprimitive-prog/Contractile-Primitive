## Summary

This session produced the first confirmed visible contraction of a Cortson BioFiber strand under controlled electrical pulsing. While the motion amplitude was limited, the test validated the core hypothesis that sequential electromagnetic activation of interleaved steel cores can generate linear contraction rather than simple attraction or vibration.

---

## Test Configuration

- Three electromagnetic cores mounted along a single BioFiber track.
- Coils wound with 14 AWG copper wire.
- Manual pulse control via salvaged drill trigger (PWM-style analog input).
- Power supplied at approximately 20–24 V.
- Activation performed using short-duration tap pulses to limit thermal rise.

---

## Observed Behavior

- Clear, repeatable micro-contraction observed during pulse activation.
- Motion was linear along the axis of the strand rather than rotational.
- Contraction occurred only during active pulse; no mechanical latch behavior.
- Sequential pulsing produced smoother motion than single-coil activation.
- Audible electromagnetic response confirmed consistent energization.

## Thermal & Electrical Notes

- Rapid temperature rise observed under sustained activation.
- Short pulse durations (<200 ms) required to maintain safe handling temperatures.
- Thermal behavior confirms need for duty-cycle control and rest intervals.
- Results validate necessity of future thermal mitigation strategies.

---

## Design Implications

- Confirms feasibility of linear electromagnetic muscle behavior.
- Supports continued development toward staged, wave-based activation.
- Indicates future gains will depend on:
  - Improved magnetic flux coupling
  - More efficient coil geometry
  - Better thermal dissipation
- Reinforces need for electronic control beyond manual triggering.

## Documentation

- Video footage captured of visible contraction behavior.
- Footage retained for internal reference and future public documentation.

---

## Next Steps

- Refine core alignment to improve contraction efficiency.
- Begin exploration of alternative core geometries and lamination patterns.
- Design a dedicated electronic pulse controller (early Pulse Node concept).
- Evaluate wire gauge tradeoffs for resistance vs. thermal performance.

---

## Status

- Core concept validated.
- Visible motion confirmed.
- Proceeding toward controlled actuation development.
