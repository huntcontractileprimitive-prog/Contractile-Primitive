## Purpose

This entry marks the closure of the initial reflex validation phase of ForceFiber development.

The goal of this phase was to determine whether electromagnetic contraction cells could be repeatedly pulsed, observed, and classified as a reflexive mechanical response without invoking higher-level control systems.

---

## Achievements to Date

- Verified repeatable contraction under manual pulse input
- Confirmed that inter-core attraction produces measurable, directional pull
- Identified spacing, taper geometry, and winding consistency as dominant variables
- Demonstrated that contraction behavior can be observed without sensor mediation

These results establish a physical reflex baseline.

---

## Explicit Non-Claims

This project phase does not claim:
- Autonomy
- Learning
- Intelligence
- Optimization
- Performance readiness

All results remain confined to controlled bench conditions.

---

## Methodological Boundary

This note intentionally closes the reflex-only phase.

Any subsequent work involving:
- Sensor feedback
- Timing orchestration
- Pattern formation
- Memory or learning constructs

Must be documented as a new phase with explicit scope definition.

---

## Archival Intent

This note exists to prevent scope creep when reviewing early work.

Future readers should be able to distinguish:
- What was physically demonstrated
- What was conceptual
- What remains speculative

---

## Status

- Reflex phase complete
- Foundation established
- Next phase pending formal definition
