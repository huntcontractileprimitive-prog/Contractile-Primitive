# Contraction Documentation Prep — Workspace and System Staging

Date: June 9, 2025  
Location: Cortson Forge (Home / Desk Lab)  
Project: Cortson BioFiber / ForceFiber  
Generation Context: Gen 1.0 → Gen 1.8 comparative review  
Note Index: 007  

---

## Context

With multiple ForceFiber iterations now physically present (early proof cells through Gen 1.8), preparation began for systematic documentation of contraction behavior.

This note records the setup and intent to visually and spatially document the evolution of the system, rather than introduce new hardware changes.

---

## Objective

To prepare a clean, repeatable workspace configuration for:

- Visual comparison of BioFiber / ForceFiber generations
- Clear observation of contraction motion
- Consistent framing for future documentation
- Establishing a baseline reference for later test footage

This is a documentation and staging phase, not a performance test.

---

## Workspace Preparation

- Forge desk cleared and reorganized
- All known ForceFiber iterations laid out in approximate chronological order
- Components staged left-to-right to reflect development progression
- Tools removed from immediate field of view to reduce visual noise
- Overhead and front-facing camera positions evaluated (no filming yet logged)

The goal was clarity, not presentation polish.

---

## System Inventory (At Time of Note)

- Early free-air contraction cells
- Pre-shielded tapered-core solenoids
- Gen 1.7–1.8 wound core units
- Partial sheath and mesh experiments (non-integrated)
- Pulse Node v0.6 available for later synchronization tests

No new components were fabricated during this session.

---

## Observations

- Visual ordering revealed clear evolution in mechanical discipline
- Later units showed improved alignment consistency
- Earlier builds highlighted uncontrolled field dispersion
- Documentation value increased when systems were physically compared side-by-side

This reinforced the importance of preserving early artifacts rather than discarding them.

---

## Design Insight

Documentation is not downstream of engineering — it is part of engineering.

Being able to *see* the progression of motion systems provides insight into:
- What problems were actually solved
- Which changes mattered
- Which intuitions were false or incomplete

This preparation phase supports future technical validation.

---

## Status

Workspace staged and ready for future contraction documentation.  
No testing performed during this session.
