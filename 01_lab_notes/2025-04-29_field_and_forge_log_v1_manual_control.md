## Summary

This session marked the first physical construction and bench testing of a manually controlled electromagnetic BioFiber strand. One-third of the planned prototype was completed, and core feasibility of electromagnetic contraction under manual pulse control was validated.

---

## Fabrication Progress

- Completed one of three planned electromagnet cores using 14 AWG copper wire.
- Core constructed on a 2-inch steel pipe clamp with approximately 200 manual wraps.
- Integrated steel braided mesh tubing to act as a guided flex channel and load-bearing tendon.
- Mounted prototype components on a temporary structural frame for bench testing.

---

## Control System Development

- Salvaged a PWM trigger and polarity switch from a cordless drill.
- Repurposed drill trigger as a variable power controller for real-time analog muscle control.
- Bench-tested coil using direct ~20V input via trigger-controlled pulsing.
- Confirmed polarity reversal functionality for bidirectional magnetic testing.
- Manual tap-pulse method used to avoid overheating during early tests.

---

## Material Sourcing

- Acquired and staged the following materials:
  - 14 AWG copper wire
  - Two additional steel pipe clamps
  - Steel braided mesh sleeve
  - Structural lumber and mounting hardware
- Prepared additional components for completion of remaining coils.

---

## Electrical Observations

- Estimated resistance for 14 AWG coil at 200 wraps: ~0.84 ohms.
- Estimated current spike during pulse: ~24A at ~20V.
- Manual pulsing confirmed necessary to avoid excessive thermal buildup.
- Coil demonstrated stable magnetic response during short-duration activation.

---

## Design Insights

- Dual-coil opposition mirrors biological muscle tension pairing.
- A tri-coil configuration enables directional contraction via sequential pulsing (A → B → C).
- System exhibits early signs of controllable linear tension rather than rotational motion.
- Current configuration prioritizes proof-of-concept over efficiency or longevity.

---

## Next Stage Objectives

- Complete winding of the remaining two electromagnet coils.
- Mount three coils evenly along the BioFiber track.
- Wire A–B–C channels for sequential pulse testing.
- Integrate PWM trigger into a handheld or arm-mounted controller shell.
- Test contraction modes: single-coil, push–pull dual-coil, and tri-coil wave actuation.
- Begin video documentation of visible synthetic muscle behavior.

---

## Status

- Prototype construction in progress.
- Manual control system verified functional.
- Ready to advance toward Phase 2 structured motion testing.
