## Objective

To reclassify the ongoing paddle-based contraction tests and clarify their role as reflex-loop validation rather than full system demonstrations.

---

## Reframe Summary

The current test setup—manual pulse input driving ForceFiber contraction—is best understood as a reflex validation loop.

The system under test includes:

- Input stimulus (button or trigger)
- Immediate electromagnetic contraction response
- Observable mechanical behavior
- Thermal and electrical side effects

This loop mirrors a basic reflex arc rather than a learned or coordinated behavior.

---

## Test Classification

These tests are classified as:

- Reflex-level actuation tests
- Proof of repeatable contraction under controlled input
- Validation of physical response timing

They are not intended to demonstrate:

- Autonomous behavior
- Optimization
- Application-level performance
- Coordinated multi-segment motion

---

## Rationale

Maintaining this classification prevents over-interpretation of results and keeps evaluation grounded in measurable physical behavior.

This framing ensures that future work can cleanly build upward—from reflex to coordination—without retroactive reinterpretation.

---

## Status

- Test scope clarified
- Reflex framing adopted for all current contraction demos
- Continued testing authorized under this classification
