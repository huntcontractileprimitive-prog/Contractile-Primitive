## Objective

To define the scope of the active feedback loop under development and clarify which subsystems are considered in-scope for current experimentation.

---

## Feedback Loop Definition

The active feedback loop under investigation consists of:

- Electromagnetic contraction via ForceFiber cells
- Real-time electrical input modulation
- Measured response through current, temperature, and mechanical behavior
- Iterative adjustment of pulse timing and duration

The loop is intentionally limited to physical signals directly observable at the strand and controller level.

No external optimization models or high-level decision systems are included at this stage.

---

## Control Boundary Clarification

The current development boundary includes:

- Coil actuation timing
- Power delivery constraints
- Thermal response and cooldown behavior
- Mechanical alignment stability

Out of scope at this stage:

- Application-specific behavior
- High-level task planning
- Multi-limb coordination
- User interface abstraction

This boundary is maintained to ensure that observed behavior can be directly attributed to physical configuration and control timing.

---

## Data Handling Notes

All observations are intended to be recorded as:

- Time-stamped actuation events
- Corresponding electrical and thermal responses
- Qualitative notes on mechanical behavior

Data interpretation is deferred until repeatable behavior is confirmed.

---

## Status

- Feedback loop scope defined
- Development boundary explicitly constrained
- Ready for continued testing under controlled conditions
