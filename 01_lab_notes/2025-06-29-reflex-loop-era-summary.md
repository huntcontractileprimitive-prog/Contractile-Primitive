## Scope

This entry consolidates the transition period where ForceFiber testing shifted from isolated contraction proof toward structured reflex-loop framing.

The focus during this interval remained strictly on physical validation and classification—not application or performance claims.

---

## Key Developments

- Recognition that current paddle-driven tests represent reflex validation rather than higher-order control
- Formal adoption of "Reflex Loop" terminology to describe:
  - Input stimulus
  - Immediate contraction response
  - Measurable physical effects
- Reinforcement of a bottom-up development path:
  - Reflex → coordination → pattern → learning

---

## Workspace and Process

All active prototypes (v1.0 through v1.85) were laid out sequentially to preserve physical lineage and maintain clear developmental traceability.

Testing remained manual and observable, emphasizing repeatability and material behavior over optimization.

---

## Psychological and Methodological Notes

Clarity improved once the reflex classification was adopted.

This reduced internal pressure to justify system-level claims prematurely and allowed testing to remain focused on fundamentals.

---

## Technical Status

- No new hardware architecture introduced
- No control algorithms finalized
- No autonomous behaviors asserted

The system remains in reflex-validation phase only.

---

## Forward Constraint

Future work must explicitly document transitions between:
- Reflex behavior
- Coordinated control
- Learned or adaptive response

This note serves as a boundary marker for that transition.

---

## Status

- Reflex Loop Era defined
- Scope boundaries documented
- Proceeding cautiously and deliberately
