## Objective

To finalize the physical layout parameters for the current ForceFiber strand configuration and clarify system-level terminology for ongoing documentation.

---

## Strand Layout Definition

The Gen 1.85 strand configuration was finalized with the following characteristics:

- Five contraction cells arranged linearly
- Toroidal or toroid-compatible core geometry
- Iron-based sheath intended for magnetic channeling and compression support
- Defined internal routing for power and sensor wiring

This layout establishes a repeatable baseline for subsequent mechanical and electrical testing.

---

## Structural and Routing Considerations

Key considerations identified during layout definition:

- Consistent center-to-center spacing between contraction cells is critical for predictable behavior
- Wiring paths must avoid sharp bends and minimize electromagnetic interference
- Sheath integration must allow limited radial compression without restricting axial motion

These constraints will inform future fixture design and assembly methods.

## Terminology Clarification

The term “Synthetic Consciousness Drift (SCD)” was refined for internal use.

Within the scope of this project, SCD refers to:

A motion-driven self-correction process in which repeated actuation cycles influence future control behavior through recorded feedback and adjustment.

This definition is descriptive, not philosophical, and is used to label a class of feedback-informed control behavior rather than a cognitive claim.

## Status

- Strand layout locked for Gen 1.85
- Terminology standardized for documentation consistency
- Ready to proceed with controlled testing under fixed geometry
