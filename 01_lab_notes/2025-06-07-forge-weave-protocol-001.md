## Context

As ForceFiber core contraction tests progressed, it became increasingly clear that magnetic field control outside the core itself would be critical to improving efficiency, consistency, and thermal behavior.

This note documents the first intentional exploration of a **ferromagnetic compression sheath** — not as armor, but as a **magnetic return path and field-shaping structure**.

---

## Objective

To test whether a braided soft-iron sheath surrounding the contraction core could:

- Redirect stray magnetic flux back into the system
- Improve contraction efficiency
- Add passive compression and alignment stability
- Reduce field leakage into surrounding space

This is an exploratory protocol, not a finalized design.

---

## Construction Method (Initial Test)

- Braided sheath constructed using **6 strands of mild steel wire**
- Wire gauge: approximately 24–28 AWG (hand-selected scrap wire)
- Braiding pattern: alternating over–under, rotating cylindrical weave
- Sheath formed directly by hand without jig or mandrel
- Partial-length sheath only (not full core coverage)

The braid was wrapped around a test core to evaluate fit, stiffness, and magnetic behavior.

---

## Observations

- The braid naturally self-tightens under slight axial compression
- Magnetic attraction appears to bias flux laterally along the braid
- Early signs suggest improved field containment near the core
- The sheath adds mechanical structure without rigid constraint
- Installation and removal are possible without damaging the core

No quantitative force measurements were taken during this phase.

---

## Design Insight

The sheath does **not** behave like passive shielding.

Instead, it functions more like:
- A low-reluctance magnetic return channel
- A compressive fascia analog
- A structural memory layer that responds to field activation

This suggests the sheath is an active participant in contraction dynamics, not a protective afterthought.

---

## Next Steps Identified

- Repeat braid with consistent wire gauge and length
- Test double-layer braids for increased flux guidance
- Explore epoxy-embedded iron mesh (FerroCast hybrid)
- Integrate sheath into upcoming Gen 1.9C builds
- Observe thermal behavior under pulsed operation

## Builder Reflection (Recorded at Time)

“The braid is not armor. It is memory made into structure.”

This reflection is preserved here as part of the development record.
