## Objective

To explore hand-fabricated ferromagnetic sheath structures capable of acting as a magnetic return path and compression guide for ForceFiber contraction cells.

This work responds directly to the containment requirement identified in Note 014.

## Construction Method

A braided sheath was produced using six strands of soft iron / mild steel wire in a rotating over-under pattern around a cylindrical mandrel.

Key characteristics:

- Flexible under bending
- Structurally compressive under axial load
- Magnetically conductive along braid direction
- Mechanically tolerant to repeated motion

The braid was not bonded or cast during this phase.

---

## Observations

- The braid exhibits directional stiffness while remaining radially compliant
- Ferromagnetic attraction to the braid is noticeably stronger along the axis
- The sheath naturally resists outward expansion when compressed
- Manual flex testing showed no brittle failure or permanent deformation

This suggests suitability as a non-rigid magnetic return structure.

---

## Magnetic Implications

The braided geometry creates multiple parallel low-reluctance paths for magnetic flux while avoiding a solid shell.

This may allow:

- Improved axial field focus
- Reduced lateral flux leakage
- Passive field shaping without active components
- Compatibility with linear contraction motion

No quantitative field measurements were taken at this stage.

---

## Design Insight

Containment does not need to be solid to be effective.

Flexibility and magnetic continuity can coexist.

## Status

- Forge Weave Protocol 001 logged
- Identified as candidate containment layer
- Planned integration with Gen 1.9C test strand
- Quantitative testing pending
